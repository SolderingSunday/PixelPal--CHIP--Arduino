// Pixel Pals have 3 important pins
// Ground (GND) -- plugged into to Arduino GND
// Right Eye LED (D10) --> plugged into to Arduino D10
// Left Eye LED (D11) --> plugged into to Arduino D11

// We need to define the eyes so we can use them in our code
int rEye = 10; //define right eye as pin12 on the Arduino
int lEye = 11; //define right eye as pin11 on the Arduino

long blinkTime;            // when to blink nexts (in ms)
boolean eyesOpen = true;   // track if eyes open or closed
             

// Next we need to initialize the Arduino pins
// setup() only runs once when you power or reset an Arduino
void setup(){
  pinMode(rEye, OUTPUT); //set right eye for output
  pinMode(lEye, OUTPUT); //set left eye for output
  blinkTime = millis() + 2000 + random(10000);  // set next blink time
}


//loop runs forever - this is our main code
void loop(){
  
  long curTime = millis(); // get current time (ms since start)
  
  if (curTime > blinkTime){       // time to change status
    if (eyesOpen){
      eyesOpen = false;          // need to blink
      // The duration of a blink is between 100-400ms according to the 
      // Harvard Database of Useful Biological Numbers.
      blinkTime = curTime + 100 + random(300); // length of blink
    }
    else{
      eyesOpen = true;           // open eyes
      // Generally, between each blink is an interval of 2â€“10 seconds; actual rates vary by individual.
      blinkTime = curTime + 2000 + random(10000); // next blink time  
    }
  } 
    
  // turn eyes on or off, depending on eyesOpen variable
  digitalWrite(rEye, eyesOpen);     
  digitalWrite(lEye, eyesOpen); 
}
